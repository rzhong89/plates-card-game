# Plates: An Original Card Game

## The Pack
- Each player needs at least 18 cards. For 3 players, round up and use 2 standard 52-card decks.
## Object of the Game
- The goal is to end the game with the least total card value in your primary and secondary hands.
## Rank of Cards
- Cards rank from Ace (high) to Two (low). Suits are irrelevant. Aces can be used to clear the plate.
## The Deal
- Any number of players can play.
- Each player receives a 10-card primary hand and an 8-card secondary hand from a well-shuffled deck.
Players can look at all their primary hand cards but only flip and look at 4 of their secondary hand cards. The remaining cards are set aside.
## The Play
- The player with the highest total value from their revealed secondary hand cards goes first and places a card (or multiple cards of the same value) in the middle (on the "plate").
- The player can pick cards from either their primary or revealed secondary hand.
- If the card played is an Ace or four cards of the same value, the plate is cleared, and the player gets another turn.
- The next player clockwise must place a card of the same or lower value than the card(s) on the plate. If they play any number of cards and it is the same as the current card on the plate and there are 4 of them, the plate can be cleared, and the player gets another turn.
- If a player cannot match or play a lower value card, they take all cards on the plate into their primary hand and place any card or cards of the same value on the plate.
- Once all 4 revealed secondary hand cards have been played, the player can use their unrevealed secondary hand cards. They cannot look at these cards until they are placed on the plate. If they have matching cards in their primary hand, they can combine them in the same turn.
## Ending the Game
- The game ends when a player gets rid of all cards in both hands. After that, each remaining player gets one more turn. Add up all your cards and write down the sum for each player. If you have an Ace left in any of your decks, it is worth 50 points.
- Multiple rounds are usually played. The total value of cards each player has at the end of each round is recorded, and the player with the least total value after all rounds wins.
## Additional Clarifications
### Clearing the Plate:
- If a player places four of the same card or an Ace, they immediately clear the plate and get another turn.
- If a player plays any number of cards, and it matches the current card(s) on the plate to make a total of 4 of that card, the plate can be cleared, and the player gets another turn.
### Combining Cards:
- When using unrevealed secondary hand cards, if they match cards in the primary hand, players can combine them during their turn.
